EDD-Recount-Earnings
====================

Allows you to recalculate the earnings of products in EDD. Useful if product earnings get off somehow.

This adds a "Recount Earnings" link in the Download Stats meta box for each product.

This might make it into core, see [issue #1479](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues/1479)
